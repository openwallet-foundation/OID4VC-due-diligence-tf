# OID4VC Due Diligence Task Force

## Introduction/Background Material

Currently, the [OID4VC](https://openid.net/openid4vc/) components for implementing decentralized identities such as [OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) and [OID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html) are gaining traction, especially in Europe. These specifications are required by the European digital identity Architectural Reference Framework but also getting significant attention outside of Europe. 

This task force will investigate the specifications belonging to the OID4VC family thoroughly, gather information about the needs of implementers, check the existing implementations, identify gaps, and come up with a plan how OWF projects can enable OID4VC implementations.

## Objectives & Goals

- Bring existing or new code for OID4VC to OWF  
_Create a plan for hosting implementations, if no codebase can be migrate then create a plan for suitable OID4VC implementations at OWF_
- Survey interested implementers needs  
_Understand what implementers are seeking for_
- Deep dive into the specifications and profiles
- Survey existing implementations
- Foster and facilitate ecosystems for OID4VC protocol family implementations  
_Create an environment for implementers to demonstrate their implementation to the audience_
- Contacting the (potential) implementors to see whether they'd be open for hosting their work at OWF in an open development model [x] 
- Coordinate automated test events and provide interoperability tests

## List of Deliverables or Work Products

- Creation of the following documents: 
    1. Definition of the necessary components and endpoints for the implementation of OID4VC specifications (potentially based on profiles of OID4VC)
    1. List of the requirements of interested implementers (e.g. features & platforms)
    1. Report of existing implementations (e.g. detailed feature set & platforms)
- Contacting and documenting the (potential) implementors and their response to see whether they'd be open for hosting their work at OWF with full autonomy of the contributing parties
- In the case of multiple ecosystems, facilitating compatibility between implementations with (interoperability) tests --> Running automated conformance tests with specifications in the build repositories
- Creation of a project plan for the continuation of the work as OWF projects

## Remarks/Notes - Profiles
There are also interoperability profiles such as [high assurance profile](https://vcstuff.github.io/high-assurance-profile/draft-high-assurance-profile-oid4vc-sd-jwt-vc.html) that should be reviewed to ensure the potential wallet ecosystem is interoperable with other implementations that are compatible with the profile. 

## Meetings

We meet virtually every week on Wednesdays at 5pm CEST, starting on the 21st of June 2023.

If you want to attend, please reach out to @hkny or @tlodderstedt. We will provide you with the conference details.
