# OID4VC Due Diligence Task Force

## Introduction/Background Material

Currently, the [OID4VC](https://openid.net/openid4vc/) components for implementing decentralized identities such as [OID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html) and [OID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html) are gaining traction, especially in Europe. These specifications are required by the European digital identity Architectural Reference Framework but also getting significant attention outside of Europe. 

This task force would investigate the specifications belonging to the OID4VC family thoroughly, check the existing implementations, and start the preliminary work for potentially creating/hosting a reference implementation or a framework that can be used by a wider community for application implementations.

## Objectives

- Deep dive into the specifications
- Survey existing implementations
- Contacting the (potential) implementors to see whether they'd be open for hosting their work at OWF
- Create a plan for hosting and continue the work for the reference implementation, if no codebase can be migrate then create a plan for the reference implementation /framework for implementing wallet ecosystems at OWF

## List of Deliverables or Work Products

- Creation of a documentation that a) defines the necessary components and endpoints for the implementation of OID4VC specifications and b) reports the existing implementations
- Contacting and documenting the (potential) implementors and their response to see whether they'd be open for hosting their work at OWF
- Creation of a project plan for the continuation of the work as a OWF lab project

## Remarks/Notes - Profiles
There are also interoperability profiles such as [high assurance profile](https://vcstuff.github.io/high-assurance-profile/draft-high-assurance-profile-oid4vc-sd-jwt-vc.html) that should be reviewed to ensure the potential wallet ecosystem is interoperable with other implementations that are compatible with the profile.
